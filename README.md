# HTMLL Banner boilerplate
Base setup for a HTML5 banner rich media ad project automated using Gulp

First download the zip and extract it where you are going to need it.

Rename the folder to whatever you need your project to be.

Open your command line tool of choice and navigate to the renamed folder.

If you have not worked with Gulp before you will need to install a couple of things before going any further.
First you need NodeJS <link here> and here's a tutorial on how to do it <link here>
Then you can install Gulp <link here>

Do make sure you have it all installed. My goal here is to have as much automated as possible so, that you can focus only on the less boring parts of buiding a HTML ad.

The dependencies you will need are:
gulp
